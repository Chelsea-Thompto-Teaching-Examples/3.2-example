# The Fog

## Overview
### Concept
This project is based on my ongoing research of fog as a figure of fear/the unknown in popular culture, the horror genre, and military science. The goal of this research draws from Susan Strykerâ€™s embrace of trans monstrosity to find inspiration for future tactics for trans liberation drawn from the nature/form/perception of fog.

### Software
